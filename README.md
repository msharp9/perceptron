This jupyter notebook contains code to build a perceptron algorithm from scratch as well as demonstrate how to use the scikit-learn perceptron.  
It was geared toward new audience.  It gives an overview of machine learning and where it fits in within the AI field, a brief history of where the perceptron comes from, and the linear algebra needed to create the model.

This was created to present at local Meetups as well as at my work.
